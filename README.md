Plant Disease Detection &amp; Pesticide Suggestion

Iâ€™m excited to share my final year major project on GitHub: AI-Based Plant Disease Detection & Pesticide Recommendation System. This project represents months of research, development, and testing to address real-world challenges in agriculture using artificial intelligence and IoT.

By leveraging machine learning and sensor technology, this system aims to empower farmers with timely, accurate insights into crop health and sustainable pest control. I hope this project can serve as a useful resource or starting point for others passionate about agri-tech, AI, and sustainable solutions
